# Jetpack Search Extractor

:warning: in development :warning: 

Jetpack Search Extractor lets you select custom post meta from your pages, and add it to your managed Jetpack index. 

It works by copying your page's post meta into [a new field that is already setup to be searchable by Jetpack ](https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/blob/99e9223fad2e2fc97850c6ab6819c9ddedd7bca8/packages/sync/src/modules/class-search.php#L48).
